1) About the Dataset:
The dataset consists of 10,886 records and 12 columns related to bike rentals.
Key columns include:
Datetime: Timestamp of bike usage
Season: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter
Holiday & Working Day: Indicates if a ride occurred on a holiday or workday
Weather: Categories of weather conditions (clear, mist, light snow, heavy rain)
Temperature & Humidity: Environmental factors affecting rides
Casual & Registered Users: Number of non-registered and registered users
Total Count: Total number of bike rentals
No missing values and no duplicate records were found.
The dataset captures rental data across different seasons, weather conditions, and user types.
2) Insights from the Project:
General Trends
The majority of rentals occur during Fall and Summer seasons.
Casual users prefer weekends, while registered users have a balanced ride pattern across all days.
Peak riding hours are during the afternoon and evening.
Impact of Weather
Temperature positively influences bike rentals: More rentals occur on warmer days.
Humidity has a negative effect: Higher humidity leads to fewer bike rentals.
Weather conditions significantly impact demand:
Clear weather results in the highest demand.
Rain and snow significantly reduce the number of rentals.
Statistical Findings
No significant difference in bike rentals between weekdays and weekends.
ANOVA test confirmed that weather conditions significantly affect rental demand.
Seasonality affects demand: The rental count varies significantly across seasons.
Recommendations:
Increase bike availability in peak seasons like summer and fall.
Introduce discounts during low-demand seasons (winter) to boost ridership.
Weather-based pricing strategies: Offer discounts on humid or rainy days to maintain usage.
Target casual users with weekend promotions and partner with tourism activities.
Improve infrastructure (bike lanes, docking stations) in high-demand locations.
